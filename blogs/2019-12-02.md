How to better stand ups
======

------

Typical standups:

- What did I work on yesterday?
- What am I working today?
- What issues are blocking me?

Standups don’t carve out time for decision-making, which is the ultimate blocker. Rather, standups are designed to simply make the blocker known, yet not resolve the blocker. Resolution matters more than awareness.

Better version:

- Action items: who is handling what key action item and by what date?
- What decisions need to be made?

To prepare for running effective product team meetings (i.e. decision-making meetings), I would go to each function lead on the product team (design, engineering, marketing, etc.) and ask them what decisions they needed made.

### Average of your five friends

### Focus on your strengths

Well, I define a talent as an innate ability, and a strength as something that gives you energy.

One sign that something gives you energy is that you stay up all night doing it.

### Ask for help

### Lean into your fear

When you feel fear it’s a sign that you should lean in.

### Happiness conditional on external factors

Every feeling, every emotion, they’re all generated internally. If you try to satisfy them externally then you will fail.


### Embrace your body 

### Be less tied to being right
